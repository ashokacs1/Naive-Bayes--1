        "\n",
        "Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula used to determine the probability of a hypothesis given prior knowledge. It describes the relationship between conditional probabilities, which are probabilities of an event occurring given that another event has occurred. Bayes' theorem helps in updating the probability of a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available. It is widely used in various fields, such as statistics, machine learning, and decision-making.\n",

        "\n",
        "Bayes' theorem is fundamentally based on conditional probability. Conditional probability is the probability of an event occurring given that another event has already occurred. Bayes' theorem formalizes how we can reverse the conditioning between events. That is, it helps in calculating the probability of event \\( A \\) given \\( B \\) by using the probability of \\( B \\) given \\( A \\). The formula for conditional probability is key to understanding how Bayes' theorem works.\n",

        "1. **Gaussian Naive Bayes:** Used for continuous data that follows a normal (Gaussian) distribution. Ideal for datasets where the features are continuous and approximately normally distributed.\n",
        "2. **Multinomial Naive Bayes:** Suitable for discrete data and often used in text classification where features are word counts or frequencies (like spam filtering).\n",
        "3. **Bernoulli Naive Bayes:** Best for binary/boolean features, often used for datasets where the features represent binary outcomes (e.g., presence or absence of a feature).\n",
